Repository for the Agent Based Technique

model.py: it contains the agent and the model initializations and asctions for each step
server.py: it contains all the info for the visualization
run.py: it is "standard" and needed to run the code

How to run the agent simulator:
1. create a python3 virtual environment
2. install mesa, matplotlib and jupiter in the environment
3. copy in a folder model.py, run.py, server.py
4. activate the virtual environment from the terminal (command: "source *environment_name*/bin/activate")
5. go in the folder where you have the three files (command: "cd *path_to_folder*")
5. write the command "mesa runserver"



------------------------  TO BE DONE  ----------------------------------
1. adjust the energy exchange between prosumers on bus one
2. try simulation with more "decent" data
3. incorporate BC
